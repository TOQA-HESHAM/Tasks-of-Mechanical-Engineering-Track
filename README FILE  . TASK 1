Project Title:
Design a 3D Robotic Arm with 5 Degrees of Freedom

General Objective:
To design and build a 3D model of a robotic arm using Tinkercad with five degrees of freedom (5-DOF), illustrating the basic mechanical structure, motion capabilities, and articulation points commonly found in robotic manipulators.
